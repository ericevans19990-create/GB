# Example environment variables for building the site
# If you deploy the frontend as static files on Hostinger (shared hosting),
# set VITE_FORM_ENDPOINT to the URL where form submissions should be sent.
# Example using Formspree (replace <form-id> with your Formspree form id):
VITE_FORM_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/<form-id>

# Or a custom endpoint:
# VITE_FORM_ENDPOINT=https://api.example.com/api/form

# How to send form data: 'json' (default) sends application/json, 'form' sends application/x-www-form-urlencoded
# If your provider expects urlencoded data (Formspree, some providers), set:
VITE_FORM_ENCODE=json
